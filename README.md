# FullSensorIrrigation (FSI) System on Arduino

## About
This project was one that I had to make for the Computer Architecture / Embedded Systems course. 
It is built entirely on a single Arduino and one .ino program. The complete list of items is as follows:

- 1x Soldering Iron
- 1x Soldering flux
- 1x Solder spool
- 1x Brass Sponge
- 1x Eye protection glasses
- 1x N95 Facemask
- 1x Arduino Uno
- 1x Arduino Uno prototype shield
- 1x Regular size breadboard
- 1x Mini size breadboard
- 1x Bunch of Jumper wires; Needed: 6x Red (+), 6x Black (-), Orange (CLK, 0.96 OLED and DHT20 Sensor), Yellow (Data In, Soil sensor), 
- 1x Battery pack
